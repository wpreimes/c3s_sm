Processing tools and tutorials for users of the C3S satellite soil moisture
service ( https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.d7782f18 ). Written in Python.

Installation
============

The c3s_sm package can be installed via

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install c3s_sm

Tutorials
=========

We provide (general) tutorials on using the C3S Soil Moisture data:

- `Tutorial 1: DataAccess from CDS & Anomaly computation <https://c3s-sm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/T1_DataAccess_Anomalies.html>`_

These tutorials are designed to run on `mybinder.org <mybinder.org/>`_
You can find the code for all examples in
`this repository <https://github.com/TUW-GEO/c3s_sm-tutorials>`_.

Supported Products
==================

At the moment this package supports C3S soil moisture data
in netCDF format (reading and time series creation)
with a spatial sampling of 0.25 degrees.

Contribute
==========

We are happy if you want to contribute. Please raise an issue explaining what
is missing or if you find a bug. We will also gladly accept pull requests
against our master branch for new features or bug fixes.

Development setup
-----------------

For Development we also recommend a ``conda`` environment. You can create one
including test dependencies and debugger by running
``conda env create -f environment.yml``. This will create a new ``c3s_sm``
environment which you can activate by using ``source activate c3s_sm``.

Guidelines
----------

If you want to contribute please follow these steps:

- Fork the c3s_sm repository to your account
- Clone the repository, make sure you use ``git clone --recursive`` to also get
  the test data repository.
- make a new feature branch from the c3s_sm master branch
- Add your feature
- Please include tests for your contributions in one of the test directories.
  We use py.test so a simple function called test_my_feature is enough
- submit a pull request to our master branch
